## Issue
*  Maze size and white space
*  Color Options
*  Replay option
*  Automatically change shape and color when change option.
*  Arrow Keys in Inverse Mode
*  But that allow players to move behind the pause screen.
* New Pause Screen (Picture maybe)
    * Currently during the very first game after the program runs, pressing pause take the
maze out of sight and redraw it after un-pausing. After un-pausing, the left and right arrow keys won't work until 
starting a new game. So maybe add a new panel that is adjustable size with a pause button in the middle would be better.
*  Musics Options
    * also allow user to change music with a new music tool bar.
    * pause and start music.
* Music never stops and overlaps with new game.
    * Music also doesn't stop while the game is paused.
* Compare Settings
    * Currently, even when nothing is changed in the setting and "Ok" is pressed a new game will be made.
* Ending in Memory Mode
* Pause Screen not disappearing after starting a new game.
* Update Instruction
* Solution from player's current location.
* Update Readme.md
* Hardcode start and finish location
    * Can make the end location of the maze in the setting optional.
* Inverse mode + random control
    * Don't allow both to be on at the on at the same time.
