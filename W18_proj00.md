### Project Description:

The project is a maze game that provide users with a randomly generated maze to play with. The users 
can also customize the maze to have a unique way of playing the maze.

### Current User Stories:

* As a user, I can save my score for the maze run so that I can compare it to my previous score or to 
other players.

* As a user, I can check the solution of the maze from the starting so that I know the way to get out of the mze.
	
* As a user, I can load up a saved game so that I can re-watch my or other people's maze run

* As a user, I can look up the instruction of the game so that I know the control for the maze game.
	
* As a user, I can change the color of the board to other default colors so that it looks better to play on.
	
### Software:

  The program runs well with little to no functional bug. The main issues of the program are the user interfaces, 
but other than that no large issues. The program randomly generates a maze of a given size that can be change in 
the game setting. User can use either WASD or the arrow keys to control the player  avatar ti reach the the of the 
maze. The game provides a few different ways to play the game such as inverse control, random control, and memory mode.
	
### New User Stories:
* As a user, I can customize the board with any color so that I have full control of what the maze will look like.
* As a user, I can play against an AI enemy so that it increases the difficulties of the maze.
* As a user, I can select the difficulty of the maze so that I have simplified options to choose from.
* As a user. I can check the solution from my current location so that I know exactly how to get to the end of the maze.
	
### Current README.md

  The current README.md is well formatted, however, it is very outdated. The information for the Winter 2016 updates are no
where to be found in the readme. All the new features of the program should be listed, so it is easier for people to understand
the functionality of the program.

### build.xml
  The targets all have descriptions and are easy to understand what all the targets does.
	
### Current Issues

### Current Code

Class are well divided for the most part but the MazeGui.java is really largee. Maybe can be divided up a little bit more. Manny inner class in
MazeGui.java.
