   <p>This the start of a MazeGame I am creating. So far, the game creates a maze (slower than actual maze-generation time so that you can watch it grow) then solves it. The algorithm I use to generate the maze is based off of the recursive back-tracker algorithm. I modified the algorithm, however, to run first off of the newest added cell, then the oldest added cell in each iteration. This form of the algorithm generates a sort of branching effect from the point of origin. I also modified the algorithm to be able to randomply spawn new points of origin at a certain specified frequency (from command line arguments; jws uses default values) as the algorithm runs. This creates a sort of "bushy", more complex maze with more grequent path branching.</p>

<p>To see how the recursive backtracker works, visit http://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2011/2/7/maze-generation-algorithm-recap</p>
<p>To better understand the idea of alternating betewen running off of the newest and oldest added cells, scroll down to the Growing Tree Algorithm and in the "Cell Selectoin Method" pulldown menu, select "Newest/Oldest, 50/50 split" and click "Run"</p>
<p>That example displays the growing up a single point of origin. My algorithm spawns these points of origin once a branch has grown to a specified size (from the command line arguments), creating a new branch. Branches grow off of branches this way, creating a sort of "bushy", more complex maze. </p>
