This project is very well thought out and complete. The build.xml files contains target that are clear and concise, and the source files are named well and defined well within the javadoc. However, some of the code could definitely be refactored to make it more clear how each function works. There also seems to be and issue with GUI capabilties on a MAC OS. This may be a local isssue, as I may be missing some external library, but nonetheless i cannot navigate through parts of the GUI on my local computer.
