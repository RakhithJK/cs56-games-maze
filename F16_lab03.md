* (a): A maze game where the player controls a dot with WASD.  The goal is to move through a randomly generated maze one square at a time to reach the goal tile.
* (b): 
..* As a user, I can press W to move upwards so that I get closer to the finish square
..* As a user, I can press A to move leftwards so that I get closer to the finish square
..* As a user, I can press S to move downwards so that I get closer to the finish square
..* As a user, I can press D to move rightwards so that I get closer to the finish square
..* As a user, I can click 'New' to generate a new maze, so that I can replay the game
..* As a user, I can click 'Solve' to show the optimal path through the maze, so I can see the best solution after finishing or giving up
..* As a user, I can click 'How to' to show a help window, so I can learn how to play
..* As a user, I can click 'High Scores' to show a high scores window, so I can compare my performance against past ones.
..* As a user, I can use the menu bar to access settings and alternate modes, so that I can customize the game to my liking
* (c): The software runs fine without issues.  It creates a fully playable, functional maze game described in part (a)
* (d): As a user, I can click a game in the High Scores panel to view a replay of it, so that I can view previous games.  As a user, I can hover over settings in the settings menu, so that I can see what they do.
* (e): The readme is thorough and detailed.  It could be updated with better organization and more specific instruction, so new users can orient themselves more easily.
* (f): The build.xml is good.  Targets have descriptions and there doesn't seem any legacy stuff
* (g): The issues look good.  They're relatively clear and reasonable, and there's plenty of them
* (h): We haven't added any issues yet
* (i): The code is organized, but not that well.  There are some comments but not that many, some of the methods bloated, and all files are in one package
* (j): There almost no unit tests.  The one test file has errors.  We could expand test coverage by writing tests
