A) Java applet that randomly generates mazes for you to solve.

B) As a gamer I can play this game so that I can have fun.
   As a bored traveler I can play this game so that I can kill time.
   As a student I can solve this puzzle so I can increase my brain's ability to solve things
   As a parent I can teach this game to my kids so they can understand how a basic puzzle works
   As a salesman who sells puzzle games I can use this game to advertise puzzle games so I can increase my clients

C1) This program runs perfectly right now. The main program is to generate a random maze for the user to solve. This maze has 2 game modes currently. You are able to set the size of the maze. Also you can put save high score (time and number of steps). There are a good amount of buttons: help, settings, and etc.
C2) As a cs-student, I can code in Java to create a new feature that will automatically generate easy, medium, hard, rather than have the user set the column, row etc
    As a cs-student, I can code in Java to create a new game feature, in which the controls can be randomly set, such that the user must figure out the controls while trying to solve the maze
    As a cs-student, I can code in Java to create a feature inwhich the user can choose what kind of sprite they want to play as
    As a cs-student, I can code in Java and create an enemy that moves towards the player, to add another level of difficulty
    As a cs-student, I can code in Java and create another reveal-like game mode, except the path already walked on is forgotten.

D) The README.md is very well maintained. Some information that could improve the README.md is by giving a brief summary of every .java file and its relation to other .java files.

E) The targets contained in the build.xml file is very clear and concise. However one issue is that some of the functions are not very clear on how they work.

F)
