other improvements:

fix the load bug - 
    	after loading a saved game, when the "new" game 
	button is pressed the timebar starts from the previous.
	UPDATE: this is much more comprehensive than previously
	expected. whenever a game is loaded, the load status dominates
	accessibility to the program. in other words, the timebar starts
	from the load time and settings cannot be altered. 
fix after save bug - 
    	after the game is saved, the saved maze is 
	erased, the frame is left blank and the user is left without 
	direction.
put in a end column/end row check - 
       the user can mistakenly put the end grid location out of bounds 
       from the maze. this should not be able to happen.
